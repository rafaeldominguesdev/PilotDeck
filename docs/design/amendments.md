## A1 — The touch floor is a pointer-conditional hit floor, not a control height

**Card:** OCL-87 · **Origin:** design review OCL-79, finding C3
· **Amends:** §1 (Air), §2 (token table), §3 (the Control), §5 (item 12, new item 16)

### The conflict, as it stood

Four passages of the doctrine could not all be true at once:

| Where | Text |
|---|---|
| §3, the Control | `height 32px · padding 0 12px · radius --oc-radius-control` |
| §1, Air | "Density is bought with padding and type size, never by shrinking targets (the 44px floor in `--nebula-tap` stays law)." |
| §2, tokens | `--oc-tap` = 44px in every theme |
| §5, item 12 | "44px touch floor held on every control (density via padding only)." |

A control cannot be a 32px box and a 44px target at the same time. The
implementation followed §3, so item 12 fails almost everywhere. Measured in
production v0.2.1: topbar controls 32px, `.mf-trigger` 16px, cost stat 19px,
`.am-theme-opt` 23px, `.mchip` 20px, `.seen-add` 30px, banner buttons 31px,
modal buttons 33px. The Settings tabs (44px) are the only place the floor holds.

### The decision

**The 44px floor is kept, and scoped to touch. The 32px Control is kept, and
scoped to a fine pointer. Neither number moves; what changes is what each one
governs.** Three rules, all binary:

1. **`--oc-tap` stays 44px in every theme**, and stops meaning "the height of a
   control". It now governs one thing: **the minimum hit-target dimension,
   both axes, under a coarse pointer.** It is never used as a `height` or a
   `min-height` on a visual box.
2. **A new token `--oc-tap-min: 24px`** carries the floor that holds
   *everywhere*, pointer included — the WCAG 2.2 AA minimum target size
   (SC 2.5.8). No interactive element in the board may have a hit box under
   24×24 CSS px on any device.
3. **The visual box is unchanged and stays a design decision:** 32px for
   compact controls, 36px for form fields (system `decisions.md` D2). Density
   is still bought with padding and type size; what §1 forbids shrinking is the
   **hit area**, which is now a distinct thing from the box.

So a 32px topbar control is compliant on a desktop (32 ≥ 24) and must present a
44px hit area on a phone. A 16px `.mf-trigger` is a **bug in every context** —
it fails the pointer floor too — which is the outcome that matters most here:
the amendment must not be readable as a license for 16px triggers.

### The technique, written so two executors converge

The hit area grows with a non-painting `::after`, centred on the element. The
element's box, its layout and its neighbours' positions do not move.

```css
/* Base utility. Every interactive element carries .oc-tappable, or is matched
   by the element selectors below in the base stylesheet. */
.oc-tappable { position: relative; }

.oc-tappable::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  translate: -50% -50%;
  width: max(100%, var(--oc-tap-min));
  height: max(100%, var(--oc-tap-min));
}

@media (pointer: coarse) {
  .oc-tappable::after {
    width: max(100%, var(--oc-tap));
    height: max(100%, var(--oc-tap));
  }
}
```

Four constraints that make it work, and that a reviewer checks:

- **No ancestor between the control and the bar may clip it.** An
  `overflow: hidden` on the row cuts the expanded area back to the visual box
  and silently reverts the fix. If the row must clip, the control's own hit
  area grows by `min-block-size` instead and the row grows with it.
- **Neighbours need `gap`.** Two 32px controls 4px apart get 44px areas that
  overlap; the later one in the DOM wins the tap. Any row of tappables under a
  coarse pointer holds `gap: var(--oc-space-2)` (8px) or more — which is what
  makes the expansion honest rather than decorative.
- **Replaced elements have no pseudo-elements.** A bare
  `input[type="checkbox"]` / `[type="radio"]` / `[type="range"]` cannot carry
  `::after`. Those are wrapped in their `<label>`, and the label is the
  `.oc-tappable`.
- **The pseudo-element paints nothing.** No background, no border, no
  `box-shadow`. It exists to receive pointer events; it inherits
  `pointer-events` from the control, so a tap on it is a tap on the control.

### Rationale

The literal reading of §1 ("never by shrinking targets") pointed at Option A —
a 44px area everywhere, including desktop. It was rejected on the evidence:

- **It is not what accessibility actually requires.** WCAG 2.2 sets the
  normative minimum at **24×24 CSS px (SC 2.5.8, AA)**, with an exception when
  spacing compensates. 44×44 comes from SC 2.5.5 (**AAA**) and from touch
  platform guidance (Apple HIG 44pt, Material 48dp) — guidance written for a
  finger, whose contact patch is ~10mm, not for a cursor with single-pixel
  precision. A 32px control with a mouse clears AA with 33% to spare.
- **Invisible 44px areas on a desktop cost more than they buy.** They overlap
  in dense bars, they steal taps from the element next door, and they make the
  clickable region disagree with the drawn region — a worse accessibility
  outcome for low-vision and motor-impaired pointer users than an honest 32px
  box, because the target you see is no longer the target you hit.
- **Desktop density is the product's direction.** This board is a work
  instrument read at 1440px with dozens of cards in view; §1's whole thesis is
  air *between* elements, not fat elements. Option C (44px controls
  everywhere) inflates the topbar by 37% in height and contradicts §3 as
  written and as already shipped.
- **The floor still binds where the risk is real.** On a phone every one of
  those measured elements — 16, 19, 20, 23, 30px — becomes a 44px target, which
  is where mis-taps actually happen.

The system doctrine already anticipated this: `system/decisions.md` D2 says
"below 768px the hit area grows to `var(--oc-tap)` without changing the visual
height". This amendment promotes that sentence into the doctrine, replaces the
width breakpoint with `(pointer: coarse)` — the honest signal, since a 1024px
tablet is a finger and a 700px window on a laptop is not — and adds the 24px
floor that D2 did not have.

### Tokens and files affected

| What | Where | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `--oc-tap` | `apps/web/src/styles/themes/nebula.css:252` (inherited by `xai`, `overclock`) | Value unchanged (44px); role redefined. Doc comment updated to "coarse-pointer hit floor". |
| `--oc-tap-min` | same file, next to `--oc-tap` | **New**, `24px`, all themes. |
| `--nebula-tap` | `apps/web/src/styles/nebula.css:146` | Alias stays; any rule using it as a `height`/`min-height` is a violation. |
| `.oc-tappable` | base stylesheet (`nebula.css`, control layer) | **New** utility, the block above. |
| Failing components | `.mf-trigger` (16px), cost stat (19px), `.mchip` (20px), `.am-theme-opt` (23px), `.seen-add` (30px), banner buttons (31px), modal buttons (33px) | Adopt `.oc-tappable`; the four under 24px are pointer-floor bugs and are fixed on both pointers. |
| Token snapshot | `apps/web/src/styles/__snapshots__/tokens.test.ts.snap` | Gains `--oc-tap-min`. |
| Guard | `apps/web/src/styles/` (sibling of `layers.test.ts`) | **New** test, see below. |

### The checklist item is now machine-checkable

Item 12 becomes: measure `el.getBoundingClientRect()` unioned with the
`::after` box for every element matching the interactive selector set, once
with `pointer: fine` and once with `pointer: coarse` emulated. Pass = every box
≥ 24×24 in the first pass and ≥ 44×44 in the second. No human judgement, no
screenshot.

### Follow-up cards (not this one)

- **Implementation:** adopt `.oc-tappable`, add `--oc-tap-min`, fix the seven
  measured components. Closes checklist 12.
- **Guard:** the Playwright/JSDOM test above, so item 12 stops being an opinion.

## A2 — When an extracted palette contradicts §1: three tiers of law

**Card:** OCL-88 · **Origin:** design review OCL-79, findings B1–B5
· **Amends:** §2 (new "Theme conformance" subsection), §5 (every item tagged, new items 17–18)

### The conflict, as it stood

§2 wrote an exemption for exactly one theme — "`nebula` must be pixel-faithful
to today" — and left `overclock` as a TODO. Then OCL-56 built `overclock` by
extracting the Overclock app's palette token by token, documenting the source of
each value, which is precisely what its scope map asked for. The result fails
~6 of the 15 checklist items **by construction**, and the file is not wrong: the
doctrine never said what happens when a real product's palette disagrees with
§1's universal laws.

Measured in `apps/web/src/styles/themes/overclock.css`:

1. `--oc-accent-rgb: 239 68 68` and `--oc-danger-rgb: 239 68 68` — accent and
   danger are the same `#ef4444`. Selected, primary, error and destructive are
   visually identical.
2. `--oc-focus-ring: 0 0 0 2px rgb(var(--oc-accent-rgb)/0.65)` and
   `--oc-border-strong: rgb(var(--oc-accent-rgb)/0.4)` — keyboard focus and
   every hover paint the error red.
3. Kill-list items return: `--oc-tag-feature-fg: #22d3ee`,
   `--oc-tag-rfc-fg: #8b5cf6`, `--oc-radius-pill: 999px`,
   `--oc-font-label: var(--oc-font-data)`, a red `--oc-plan-glow`,
   `--oc-warn: #facc15`, `--oc-info: #06b6d4`.
4. The grays carry hue: `#1f2937`, `#9ca3af`, `#6b7280` (blue slate) where
   `nebula` and `xai` use white with alpha.

### The decision

**Neither blanket exemption nor blanket conformance. The checklist splits into
two kinds of law, and a theme may only diverge from one of them — in writing.**

**Tier 1 — universal. No theme may break these, ever.** They are the rules
where breaking them changes what the user *understands*, not what they see:

| # | Law | Binary test |
|---|---|---|
| U1 | **`--oc-accent` ≠ `--oc-danger`.** A theme may not resolve both to the same colour. | The two computed colours differ by ≥25° of OKLCH hue **or** ≥0.15 of OKLCH lightness. Equal values fail. |
| U2 | **The focus ring is neutral in every theme.** It never carries the accent when the accent is a semantic colour, and never carries `--oc-danger`. | `--oc-focus-ring`'s colour has OKLCH chroma ≤ 0.04 and is not in the danger hue family. |
| U3 | **Hover and open borders are neutral.** `--oc-border-strong` is a gray-ladder value; colour is not decoration. | Same chroma test as U2. |
| U4 | **`--oc-ok` / `--oc-danger` are reserved to meaning** — status dots, status text, error text, destructive actions. A theme picks its red and green; it may not spend them elsewhere. | No other token resolves to the `--oc-ok`/`--oc-danger` values. |
| U5 | **Layout tokens are identical across themes.** A theme declares values, never a size that moves a box. | Existing checklist 14. |
| U6 | **Type ramp, Control anatomy, and the A1 hit floors** hold in every theme. | Checklist 3, 12. |

**Tier 2 — theme-scoped. A theme may diverge, and must declare it.** These are
identity and taste: accent hue (an accent need not be white), radius family
including pills, the label face (mono as the UI voice), tag foreground colours,
decorative glow, extra semantic colours (`warn`, `info`), and the hue of the
gray ladder. One guard rides along: **a Tier-2 colour may not equal `--oc-ok`
or `--oc-danger`** — a cyan `feature` tag is identity, a red one is a lie.

**Tier 3 — the declaration.** Every theme file opens with an `EXEMPTIONS`
block, one line per Tier-2 divergence with the doctrine rule it departs from and
the source of the value. **An undeclared divergence is a bug**; a declared one
is the theme. `nebula`'s exemption ("pixel-faithful to today") is restated in
this form. `xai` is the reference implementation and declares none: it is the
only theme required to pass all 15 items.

Applied to `overclock`, the theme **stays in the selector**, keeps its identity,
and changes four values:

| Token | Today | Becomes | Law |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--oc-danger-rgb` | `239 68 68` (= accent) | a red distinguishable from the accent — darker/deeper, e.g. the deep red already present as `--oc-danger-deep-rgb: 127 29 29`, or the accent's `#dc2626` hover shade promoted to danger with the accent staying `#ef4444` | U1 |
| `--oc-focus-ring` | `rgb(accent / 0.65)` (red) | the neutral verbatim ring, `rgba(209,217,235,0.55)` family | U2 |
| `--oc-focus-ring-inset` | idem | idem | U2 |
| `--oc-border-strong` | `rgb(accent / 0.4)` (red) | a gray-ladder value, e.g. the app's own `--color-faint #4b5563` | U3 |

And keeps, declared as exemptions: `--oc-radius-pill: 999px`,
`--oc-font-label: var(--oc-font-data)`, `--oc-tag-feature-fg`,
`--oc-tag-rfc-fg`, `--oc-plan-glow`, `--oc-warn`, `--oc-info`, and the hued
gray ladder — all of them sourced, line by line, from the product.

### Rationale

- **Items 1 and 2 are usability, not taste.** If selection and error are the
  same red, "this card is selected" and "this card is broken" are the same
  pixel — and no amount of brand fidelity earns that. The same red on the focus
  ring means a keyboard user walking the topbar sees every stop announce
  itself as an error. These break comprehension in *any* palette, which is
  what makes them universal rather than `xai`-flavoured.
- **The rest is legitimately the product.** Pills, mono labels, the agent
  colour spectrum, the red haze: these are what the Overclock app *is*. A
  doctrine that forbids a theme from looking like the product it dresses has
  no reason to offer a third theme at all. Option C (drop the theme) throws
  away work that did exactly what it was asked to do.
- **Blanket exemption (Option A alone) was rejected** because it makes the
  checklist unfalsifiable: with "theme-scoped" undefined, every future review
  reopens the same six findings and argues them again from zero. Tiers make the
  argument once.
- **The declaration is the cheap half of the fix.** It costs a comment block
  and converts "this theme fails 6 items" into "this theme declares 8
  exemptions and passes every universal law" — a sentence a reviewer can check
  in one pass.

### Tokens and files affected

| What | Where | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Doctrine | `docs/design/ux-v2.md` §2, §5 | This card. Tier definitions, per-item `[universal]`/`[theme]` tags. |
| `--oc-danger-rgb`, `--oc-focus-ring`, `--oc-focus-ring-inset`, `--oc-border-strong` | `apps/web/src/styles/themes/overclock.css:59, 95, 203, 205` | Four values, follow-up card. |
| `EXEMPTIONS` block | `themes/overclock.css` header, `themes/nebula.css` header | New; `xai` states "none". |
| `--oc-haze-rgb: 239 68 68` | `themes/overclock.css:69` | Reviewed under U4 — it feeds `--oc-plan-glow` (declared exemption), so it stays, but it may not reach a status surface. |
| Guard | `apps/web/src/styles/tokens.test.ts` | Gains the U1–U4 assertions, run per theme. |

Not touched by this card: the theme file itself. The doctrine lands first.

### Follow-up cards (not this one)

- **Implementation:** the four `overclock.css` values + the `EXEMPTIONS` blocks
  in all three theme files. Closes checklist items 2 (the semantic half), 10,
  16, 17.
- **Guard:** U1–U4 as assertions in `tokens.test.ts`, evaluated for every theme.
