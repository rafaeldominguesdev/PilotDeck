/**
 * Who is guessing, as far as this deployment can honestly tell.
 *
 * A forwarded-for header is written by whatever sits in front, and on a
 * directly exposed instance that is the caller itself: trusting it there
 * would hand a guesser a fresh budget per request just by varying a string,
 * which is worse than having no scope at all. So it counts only where the
 * deploy declares it is behind a proxy, and then only the last hop — the
 * entry our own proxy appended, which the caller cannot write past.
 *
 * Undeclared, everyone shares one bucket. That still refuses a burst and
 * still destroys nothing; what it loses is the ability to tell the guesser
 * apart from the honest agent, which is why the hosted overlay sets the
 * flag and the quickstart, which nobody should expose, does not.

 * never travels through a chat. Codes are single-use with a short TTL and
 * only one is active per workspace.
 *
 * The flat delay below is not what makes guessing impractical: it is paid
 * per request, so parallel guesses wait in parallel and the ceiling is the
 * caller's connection count. What bounds the guessing is the attempt budget
 * in exchangePairingCode, which stops evaluating codes for an origin that
 * has spent it. The delay stays because it costs an honest caller nothing
 * and because paying it on every refusal is what keeps the two kinds of
 * refusal — wrong code, and no budget left to look — indistinguishable.
