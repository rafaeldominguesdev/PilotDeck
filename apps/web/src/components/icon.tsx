/**
 * The icon set of the app (AGB-73).
 *
 * One source, bundled. Every glyph in this file is inline SVG shipped with
 * the page: no sprite to fetch, no font to load, no CDN, nothing that can be
 * missing on an instance behind a firewall or slow on the first paint. The
 * board is self-hosted software and its own icons are not something it should
 * have to ask the internet for.
 *
 * One weight and one optical size. Every glyph is drawn in the same 24 box,
 * with the same 1.75 stroke, the same round cap and join, and no fill: a set
 * where one icon is heavier than the next reads as a collection of borrowed
 * pieces, which is what the app had. The stroke is a constant here and not a
 * prop on purpose, because a weight that callers may pick is not one weight.
 *
 * The Nebula palette comes for free: the stroke is currentColor, so an icon
 * takes the colour of the text it sits beside and stays inside the system
 * without ever naming a hex value.
 *
 * An icon never replaces a label that carries information. It sits beside the
 * word, or it stands alone only where the meaning is unmistakable, and it is
 * always reachable by name: `label` is required, so an icon can only be
 * silent when the caller says so, by passing null, and null is for the case
 * where a visible word or an aria-label right beside it already says the same
 * thing. Repeating it would make a screen reader say it twice.
