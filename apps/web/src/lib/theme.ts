/**
 * The board's themes (OCL-56).
 *
 * A theme is a file of `--oc-*` values in styles/themes/ and an attribute on
 * the root element. Nothing else: no component knows which theme is on, no
 * layout changes, and switching is one attribute write.
 *
 * Where the choice is kept: a cookie. The board filter and the language are
 * rows in the database because they belong to a user and to a workspace; a
 * theme belongs to the screen a person is looking at, and it has to be
 * readable before React exists, on the login screen where there is no user
 * yet. A cookie answers both — it survives the reload, and the boot script
 * below reads it before the first paint, so no one ever sees the wrong
 * theme flash into the right one.
 *
 * `prefers-color-scheme` is deliberately ignored: every theme here is dark.
 *
 * The board ships two: `devterm` (the default — a monochrome terminal skin)
 * and `overclock` (the product's own palette).
